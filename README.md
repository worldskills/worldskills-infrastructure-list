Starting a new project
------------------------

	# Clone a shallow copy of the repository (no history)
	$ git clone --depth 1 git@github.com:worldskills/WorldSkills-Angular-Skeleton.git my_application
	$ cd my_application

	# remove existing git data
	$ rm -rf .git
	
	# initialize git for a new project
	$ git init
	
	$ npm install
	# see bower.json and update version numbers (latest stable for angular libs)
	$ bower update
	
	# start the project
	$ grunt serve
	
	## Troubleshooting
	If you are in windows environnement, you have to install Ruby & Compass
	https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/ => Install ruby with this installer
	Install compass => In a fresh terminal `gem install compass`

	# to build for distribution
	$ grunt build


It is recommended also to rename your application, at the moment it is called 'worldSkillsApp'

	angular.module('worldSkillsApp')

It is safe to use global search & replace to rename. There should be 18 references accross the project. 	
	
	

Routing your application
--------------------------

Routing is done with [angular-ui-router](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router)
Routing configuration can be found from **app.js**

* [API Docs](http://angular-ui.github.io/ui-router/site/#/api/ui.router)
